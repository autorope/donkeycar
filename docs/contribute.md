# Contribute to Donkey
Donkey is an open source project to help accelerate the development of
self driving autos.

###Guiding Development Principles

* **Modularity**: A self driving system is composed of standalone,
independently configurable components that can be combined to make a car.
* **Minimalism**: Each component should be kept short (<100 lines of code).
Each piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. No black magic,
it slows the speed of innovation.
* **Extensibility**: New components should be simple to create by following a
template.
* **Python**: Keep it simple.

***These guidelines are nearly copied from [Keras](http://keras.io) because they are so good***



### Add a part.
Are you a hardware specialist that can write a donkey part wrapper for a
GPS unit or a data scientist that can write an recursive neural net autopilot?
If so please write a part so other people driving donkeys can use the part.

### Fix or report a bug.
If you find a problem with the code and you know how to fix it then please
clone the repo, make your fix, and submit your pull request.

### Reply to issues.
Helping close or triage the issues is a good way to help.


### Need Inspiration?
Search the code or docs for `TODO` to find places where you might be able
to find a better solution.

### Improve the documentation.

link in the top right corner.
