# Contribute to Donkey
This is an opensource project to help accelerate the developement of self driving autos. See below how you can contribute. 

1. Submit a github issue when you find a problem with the code. 
2. Submit a github issue that describes a feature that you want. This is where the conversation can start. 
3. Fork the code, make your change and submit a pull request. 


###Guiding Developement Principles
* **Modularity**: A self driving system is composed of standalone, independently configurable modules that can be connected modules.

* **Minimalism**: Each component should be kept short (<100 lines of code). Each peice of code should be transparent apon first reading. No black magic, it slows the speed of innovation. 

* **Extensiblity**: New components should be simple to create by following a template. 

* **Python**: Keep it simple. 

***These guidelines are nearly copied from Keras because they are so good*** 


## Tests
Make sure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

Run tests with: `python -m unittest`
