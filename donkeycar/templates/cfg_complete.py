#   Available augmentations are:
#   - BRIGHTNESS  - modify the image brightness. See [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/api_reference/augmentations/transforms/#albumentations.augmentations.transforms.RandomBrightnessContrast)
#   - BLUR        - blur the image. See [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/api_reference/augmentations/blur/transforms/#albumentations.augmentations.blur.transforms.Blur)

#     - 'TRAPEZE'   - apply a trapezoidal mask to image
#   - Apply an enhancement to the image

#     - 'GRAY2BGR'  - change color model from greyscale to BGR
#
# You can create custom tranformations and insert them into the pipeline.
# - Use a tranformer label that beings with `CUSTOM`, like `CUSTOM_CROP`
#   and add that to the TRANSFORMATIONS or POST_TRANFORMATIONS list.
#   So for the custom crop example, that might look like this;
#   `POST_TRANSFORMATIONS = ['CUSTOM_CROP']`
# - Set configuration properties for the module and class that
#   implement your custom transformation.
#   - The module config will begin with the transformer label
#     and end with `_MODULE`, like `CUSTOM_CROP_MODULE`.  It's value is
#     the absolute file path to the python file that has the transformer
#     class.  For instance, if you called the file
#     `my_custom_transformer.py` and put in in the root of
#     your `mycar` folder, next to `myconfig.py`, then you would add 
#     the following to your myconfig.py file (keeping with the crop example);
#     `CUSTOM_CROP_MODULE = "/home/pi/mycar/my_custom_transformer.py"`
#     The actual path will depend on what OS you are using and what
#     your user name is.
#   - The class config will begin with the transformer label and end with `_CLASS`,
#     like `CUSTOM_CROP_CLASS`.  So if your class is called `CustomCropTransformer`
#     the you would add the following property to your `myconfig.py` file:
#     `CUSTOM_CROP_CLASS = "CustomCropTransformer"`
# - Your custom class' constructor will take in the Config object to
#   it it's constructor.  So you can add whatever configuration properties
#   you need to your myconfig.py, then read them in the constructor.
#   You can name the properties anything you want, but it is good practice
#   to prefix them with the custom tranformer label so they don't conflict
#   with any other config and so it is way to see what they go with.
#   For instance, in the custom crop example, we would want the border
#   values, so that could look like;
#   ```
#   CUSTOM_CROP_TOP = 45    # rows to ignore on the top of the image
#   CUSTOM_CROP_BOTTOM = 5  # rows ignore on the bottom of the image
#   CUSTOM_CROP_RIGHT = 10  # pixels to ignore on the right of the image
#   CUSTOM_CROP_LEFT = 10   # pixels to ignore on the left of the image
#   ```
# - Your custom class must have a `run` method that takes an image and
#   returns an image.  It is in this method where you will implement your
#   transformation logic.
# - For example, a custom crop that did a blur after the crop might look like;
#   ```
#   from donkeycar.parts.cv import ImgCropMask, ImgSimpleBlur
#
#   class CustomCropTransformer:
#       def __init__(self, config) -> None:
#           self.top = config.CUSTOM_CROP_TOP
#           self.bottom = config.CUSTOM_CROP_BOTTOM
#           self.left = config.CUSTOM_CROP_LEFT
#           self.right = config.CUSTOM_CROP_RIGHT
#           self.crop = ImgCropMask(self.left, self.top, self.right, self.bottom)
#           self.blur = ImgSimpleBlur()
#
#       def run(self, image):
#           image = self.crop.run(image)
#           return self.blur.run(image)
#   ```
